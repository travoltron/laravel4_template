Laravel 4 Template
=================

I use Laravel a lot and have to take several steps to convert it to use the built in blade template and get it set up to use Bootstrap 3. 
So I made this:

It's the latest and greatest Laravel (4.1.11 currently), set to use a template system with self-contained page sections and the latest Bootstrap 3 (with Font Awesome!) with CDN delivery. 

No LESS, no Composer packages, no custom CSS or JS. 

To use: 

1. Clone this repo into your working directory

  <code>git clone git@github.com:travoltron/laravel4_template.git .</code>

2. Run composer install (you probably don't need to do this, but it won't hurt)

  <code>composer install</code>

3. Make sure the app/storage directory is writeable 

  <code>sudo chmod 777 app/storage</code>

4. Write code.

That's it!
