Laravel 4 Template
=================

I use Laravel a lot and have to take several steps to convert it to use the built in blade template and get it set up to use Bootstrap 3. 
So I made this:

It's the latest and greatest Laravel (4.1.11 currently), set to use a template system with self-contained page sections and the latest Bootstrap 3 (with Font Awesome!) with CDN delivery. 

No LESS, no Composer packages, no custom CSS or JS. 

To use: 
1) clone this repo into your working directory
2) run composer install
3) write code

That's it!
